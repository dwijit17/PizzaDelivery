### Pizza Delivery Application

The Pizza Delivery Application is a full-stack web application designed to streamline the process of ordering and managing pizza deliveries. Built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, this application provides a user-friendly interface for customers and an efficient management system for administrators.

#### Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up and sign-in functionality for customers and administrators.
- **Order Management**: Users can add pizzas to their cart, specify sizes, quantities, and place orders.
- **Admin Panel**: Administrators can view a list of all users, manage orders, and update the status of each order (e.g., delivered, not able to deliver).
- **Cart System**: Users can view and manage the items in their cart before placing an order.


#### Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js with context API for state management and axios for API requests.
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js for server-side logic and RESTful API endpoints.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing user details, cart items, and orders.
- **Styling**: CSS and MDB React UI Kit for a modern and responsive user interface.

#### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git`
2. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` in both the root and client directories.
3. **Start the Server**: Run `npm start` in the root directory.
4. **Start the Client**: Run `npm start` in the client directory.

This application offers a seamless and efficient pizza ordering experience for users while providing administrators with the tools necessary to manage orders effectively.
